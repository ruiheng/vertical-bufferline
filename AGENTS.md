# Agent Instructions

These rules apply to all work in this repository.

## Approval Required
- Propose a plan or approach and wait for explicit approval before making code changes.
- Treat a user message of `git commit` as explicit approval to commit, and write an appropriate commit message.
- If unsure whether a change needs approval, ask first.

## Git Commit Messages
- Use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): subject`.
- Keep the subject imperative and concise.
- For non-trivial changes, include a short body explaining the rationale or analysis (skip for very small edits).

## Safety
- Do not revert or delete unrelated user changes unless explicitly asked.
- If unexpected changes appear, stop and ask how to proceed.

## Communication
- Keep responses concise.
- Confirm when a requested action is completed.
